# PhillyStartupSprint2020

This repository is a portfolio of the projects I completed while participating
in the [Philly Startup Sprint](https://www.phillystartupsprint.com/) in the 
summer of 2020. It was hosted by the [kepler group](https://www.keplergrp.com/)
as a way to replace the skills students would have gotten through internships
they lost to the COVID-19 pandemic.
