# Day 06

Today was centered around different aspects of marketing. I enjoyed the time to 
practice graphic design.

We chose one company to hypothetically acquire another one. We chose 
[Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) acquiring [goPuff](https://gopuff.com/home) since
theres the delivery and rideshare aspects. My tasks were to create the merger 
logo and also create a graphic for an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/)
post advertising the merger.

For the logo, I tried to combine the goPuff logo to include the fact Lyft 
hypothetically owns them. You can see my drafts where I messed around with what
language was used and the colors and alignment. I ended up choosing the final
logo with aspects of the Lyft pink and the goPuff blue.

For our Instagram post, we chose Will Smith as a hypothetical ambassador. He 
and the goPuff fish are driving a Lyft car through Philly at night, making those
late night snack deliveries.
