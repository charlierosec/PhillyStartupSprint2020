# Day 3

Today's focus was around proper data representation. Taking important graphs 
and data and turning it into something that people can understand and get
information from.

There were three parts to today's group activities. Our group of 7 people had a
little over an hour to complete all three tasks.

The first part was to create a sales pitch for our product, Pretzler, pretzel
flavored seltzer that was not making too much profit. There are two files that
are of note here. There's `PretzlerStats.xlsx` which contains the revenue and 
costs data we were given and some charts my teammates made. There's also
`PretzlerPitch.pdf which is a 3 slide maximum presentation for our product. I
helped here in building the theme and story elements.

In the second part we were given 5 graphics to critique. Myself and one team
member worked on this together. The graphics and our notes on them are located
in the file `DataRepresentationNotes.pdf`.

The third part is to pitch an article about data visualization. We should go to
[r/DataIsBeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/), find a graphic,
and write a short article about the visualization and explaining what the data 
visualization is telling us or showing us in an appealing way. We were given a
limit of 300 words. I was not in the section of the group that worked on this
part, so when I have the time, I want to go through and do this myself.
