# Day 2

Today's focus surrounded Google Sheets and Excel and how to use spreadsheets
effectively.

Currently the only file in here is ExcelforKids\_LombardSt.pdf. This is a
two slide presentation that is aimed at explaining the concept of the Excel
function `vLookup` to 3rd graders. I went with an approach surrounding data,
tables, and the idea a computer can fetch information for us, and then added
a touch of [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/) to appeal to younger
students. I tried to put it in a place where it could be expanded on to 
explain how functions work for higher level students.
