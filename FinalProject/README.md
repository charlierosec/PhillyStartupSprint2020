# Final Project

Our final project was to create a product, a company, a logo, branding style,
marketing plan, fake data, hiring plan, and pitch. 

Our product was a smart coffee table that connects to your devices. The product
and the things we had to do didn't interest me much, so I poured myself into
creating the logo and designing our slides. It was fun. We went through a few
iterations.
